    <h1>Test Assignment</h1>
    <p>
        Create a simple e-commerce solution.
        Do not put any effort into styling, basic formatting is enough.
        Take a minimalistic approach, only add what's strictly necessary to complete the objectives.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><s>Create a product list page</s>;</li>
        <li>Create a product page:
            <ol>
                <li>Displays product's title, price and description;</li>
                <li>Accessible by clicking the product's title in the product list page.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a cart page:
            <ol>
                <li>Displays a list of cart items with quantity, title and total price;</li>
                <li>Allows adding to cart from the product page;</li>
                <li>Allows removing items from the cart;</li>
                <li>Allows changing item quantities;</li>
                <li>Calculates and displays total cart price;</li>
                <li>Adding the same product to the cart more than once increases the quantity, but does not create a new cart item;</li>
                <li>Top menu contains a link to the cart page, link text contains the total number of products in the cart;</li>
                <li>Each visitor gets a separate cart, available for the duration of the session.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Add currency selection:
            <ol>
                <li>Currencies and exchange rates are fetched from the DB (create fixtures);</li>
                <li>Top menu contains currency selection;</li>
                <li>Selected currency is remembered for the duration of the session;</li>
                <li>All prices in the shop are displayed in the selected currency;</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Extend the product to support options:
            <ol>
                <li>Products may have a number of different options (color, size, etc.), each option having one or more possible values;</li>
                <li>Each product may have different options and option values;</li>
                <li>Not all option combinations might be available (e.g. red shoes are only available in size 44, but yellow shoes are available in sizes 44 and 45);</li>
                <li>Each unique product option combination has its own price (e.g. yellow shoes size 45 cost 99€, red shoes size 44 cost 81€, etc.);</li>
                <li>If a product has options, product page shows a radio selection of all available option combinations together with prices;</li>
                <li>Adding the same product with the same option selection to the cart more than once increases the quantity;</li>
                <li>Products with different option selections are listed separately in the cart.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create fixtures for all entities to showcase the functionality (no admin pages needed);</li>
        <li>Use Doctrine's migrations to change DB schema;</li>
        <li>You may install extra composer packages;</li>
        <li>Document notable things in the <code>README.md</code> file.</li>
    </ol>
